    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS is used to define the visual appearance and layout of web pages, including aspects such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements.

        CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. It uses a selector syntax to target specific elements and then applies various style properties to those elements.
