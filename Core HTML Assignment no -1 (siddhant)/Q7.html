    <h1> five programming quotes</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The best error message is the one that never shows up.</li>
        <li>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</li>
        <li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</li>
        <li>It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature.</li>
        <li>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.</li>
    </ul>
